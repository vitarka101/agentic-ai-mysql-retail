# Agentic AI Workflow: MySQL Query Agent (Online Retail)

This project implements an **Agentic AI workflow** in **n8n** (or ADK-based agent if specified by the course) that lets a user **query a MySQL database using plain English**.  
It is adapted from the pre-built agent shared in the syllabus and re-assigned to the **Online Retail dataset** (UCI Online Retail / course-provided link).
